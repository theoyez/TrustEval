TrustEval (theoyez.org)

TrustEval is a static, auditable evaluation framework for AI research systems. It is designed for transparency, reproducibility, and ease of deployment.

‚ú® Features

Accuracy: partial credit scoring (exact, token overlap with synonyms, regex, Levenshtein).

Grounding: hybrid policy ‚Äî per-item source keys ‚Üí domain allowlist ‚Üí RAG consistency gate.

Safety: regex packs for PII, toxicity, and policy violations, with bounded penalties.

Provenance: local snapshots + Merkle roots for strict sources.

Explainability: per-run reports with ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù traces, tooltips, breadcrumbs, and a ‚ÄúHow it works‚Äù page.

Compare view: side-by-side run comparison with Œî metrics.

Zero dependencies: no servers, no private data required ‚Äî just static files.
